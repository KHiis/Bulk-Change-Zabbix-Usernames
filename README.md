# Bulk-Change-Zabbix-Usernames
Super dumb script to alter bulk usernames in Zabbix via RubyAPI and text file.

1) Fill in the connection details for Zabbix API

  :url => 'your RPC url goes here',

  :user => 'Zabbix Super Admin user',

  :password => 'password for that user'
  
2) Run the script from your commandline
